                    created this portfolio to showcase the different skills I’ve learned throughout my school year and
                    to log my progress as I continue to grow as a person and programmer. I have included a little bit about who I am, a
                    showcase of different projects I’ve completed, and my resume. I hope you enjoy learning about me, and seeing what I learned.</p>

                Welcome to my portfolio. I am a student learning the fundamentals about web development, with
                experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this website to showcase the skills I’ve developed so
                far and to share my work with others who may be interested in what I’m building. This site includes
                several key pages:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>About me - This page is a brief summary of who I am, my interest, what has inspired me to get into
                    web development, and my future goals.</li>

                <li>Portfolio - This shows a collection of the projects, or certain aspects of said projects, that I am
                    most proud of. This is to demonstrate what I’ve learned and how I use these skills.</li>

                <li>Resume - Recreation of my resume in HTML that shows my education, experience, and skills.</li>

                <li>Contact - A way to contact me, whether for questions, or feedback on my work. This will include most
                    of my professional contact information as well as a link to my linkedin profile.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each page is clear and easy to navigate, making it easy to learn about me while allowing me to demonstrate
                what I’ve created along with my classmates throughout the schoolyear.</p>
